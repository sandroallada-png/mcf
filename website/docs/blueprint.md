## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant orange (#FF914D), suggestive of energy, warmth, and the enjoyment of food, in the spirit of 'healthy'. This will work nicely on a desaturated background in a dark scheme.
- Background color: Dark, desaturated orange (#26170F). Provides a sophisticated backdrop that makes the orange pop, and is appropriate for the overall 'dark mode' styling of the site.
- Accent color: Yellow-orange (#FFC357). Provides contrast, and an element of fun. This color should be used sparingly for highlights and calls to action.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern serif suitable for headlines.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif for body text, when longer text is needed.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Use modern, minimalist icons for key features and navigation.
- Employ a clean, intuitive layout with clear sections for each feature.
- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions to enhance user experience and provide visual feedback.
